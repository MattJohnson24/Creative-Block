            Hello! I'm Matthew, a junior studying computer science at The University at Buffalo. 
            I moved to Buffalo two years ago from Syracuse, NY where I had lived previously my whole life.
            My goal is to become a software developer as I enjoy developing ways to provide people with a
            higher quality of living.
