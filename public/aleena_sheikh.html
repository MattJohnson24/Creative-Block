            Hi:) My name is Aleena Sheikh! Iâ€™m currently a senior at the University at Buffalo majoring in 
            Computer Science. I am 22 years old and was born and raised in Staten Island, New York. 
            I decided to attend UB for its high standard of education and exceptional computer science program 
            that I knew would prepare me for my career. I look forward to working in the tech industry as a 
            software engineer after graduation.   
        </p>
