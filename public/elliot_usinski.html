            Hey, I'm Elliot! I'm a senior Computer Science student at the University at Buffalo. I enjoy data science and plan on 
            incorporating data elements into my future position at M&T. I was born and raised in Buffalo, New York and plan to stay 
            as I love the snow.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some hobbies I have on the side are playing TES: Online and writing fiction.
