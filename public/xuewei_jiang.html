            Hello! I'm Xuewei, you can call me Marvin. I'm a senior computer science student at University at Buffalo.
            I want to be a full stack developer after graduation and make some inspiring app that people love to use in a daily basis.
            I also love machine learning, which is the field I want to continue on for my Master degree. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In my spare time, I love playing games and basketball. I also like great food from all over the world.
